# ggplot2 Learn and Practice

A series of R files for learning and practicing visualization techniques using {ggplot2} package and its other extensions

## Description

Visualization is the crossroads of information sharing and true learning, which often translates to being the paramount step of communicating insights from data analysis and machine learning. I work on improving my visualization skills using ggplot2 and its extensions in R.

Within this repository you'll find .R files, datasets, and links to the resources I used to learn and practice the visualization techniques. For a complete breakdown with descriptions of what I'm learning and practicing, refer to the post link below.

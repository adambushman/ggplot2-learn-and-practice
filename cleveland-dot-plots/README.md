# Cleveland Dot Plot

I recently had a visualization challenge at work to compare precisely two values for a good number of items. I had visualization via Twitter that used horizontal bars and circles to compare the values with the items of interest descending vertically. After loads of research, I discovered this chart was called a "Cleveland Dot Plot."

## Description

We can see pretty clearly the advantages of a dot plot for comparison of two values relating to single item across multiple items. Things are organized neatly and a good deal of information can be communicated via distance, size, color, etc.

Review the files in this sub-folder for examples of basic to complex Cleveland Dot Plots.
